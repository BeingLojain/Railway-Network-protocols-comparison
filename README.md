A Railway network with its primary departments implemented using Packet Tracser using both RIP and OSPF protocols for comparison.

## Project Enhancement: Implementing Secure Routing Protocols and Network Management for Railway Networks

**Project Objective:** To enhance the security and reliability of the railway network by implementing robust routing protocols (RIP and OSPF) and a centralized network management system (Inside Railway server).

**Key Focus Areas:**
* **Secure Routing Protocols:** Explore and implement secure routing protocols like RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) to protect against routing attacks and ensure network integrity.
* **Network Management:** Develop a centralized network management system, such as an Inside Railway server, to monitor, control, and optimize network performance.
* **Database Security:** Implement robust database security measures to protect sensitive railway data from unauthorized access or modification.
* **Firewall Administration:** Configure and manage firewalls to prevent unauthorized access to the railway network and mitigate cyber threats.

**Project Approach:**
* **Routing Protocol Implementation:**
  * Configure RIP to enable efficient routing within the railway network while implementing security measures to mitigate routing attacks.
  * Configure OSPF to provide a more scalable and reliable routing solution, especially for large networks with complex topologies.
* **Network Management System:**
  * Develop or deploy an Inside Railway server to centralize network management functions, including monitoring, configuration, and troubleshooting.
  * Implement robust database security measures to protect the server's internal database, which contains critical network information.
* **Database Security:**
  * Implement encryption, access controls, and regular backups to protect the railway network's database from unauthorized access and data breaches.
* **Firewall Configuration:**
  * Configure firewalls to block malicious traffic, protect against common cyber threats, and enforce network access policies.
  * Implement intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems to detect and prevent potential attacks.

**Expected Outcomes:**
* A railway network that is more resistant to routing attacks and other security threats.
* A centralized network management system that improves operational efficiency and reduces downtime.
* A secure and reliable database that protects sensitive railway data.
* A well-configured firewall that effectively prevents unauthorized access and mitigates cyber threats.
* A comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between RIP and OSPF, and their suitability for different network scenarios.

By implementing these enhancements, the project will contribute to the development of a more secure, reliable, and efficient railway network that can withstand the challenges of modern transportation systems.
